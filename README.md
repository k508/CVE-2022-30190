# CVE-2022-30190
Mitigation for CVE-2022-30190

Script requires to be run as Adminstrator. This script has been tested with Connectwise Automate RMM tool for deployment.

I found this solution cleaner than backup up and deleting anything from the registry, as this can simply update the DWORD key value to "1" to return functionality.

Alternatively the script can be modified to find and remove the added registry key.
